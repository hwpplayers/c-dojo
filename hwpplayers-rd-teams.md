# hwpplayers hackerspace policy for it's hackathons

We provide training sessions called hackathon within [hwpplayers GitHub organization](https://github.com/hwpplayers) for everyone.

Only technical discussions and for new code base for our hackathons you may come with any Free Software/Open Source license like MIT/Expat, BSD style, AGPLv3+ or any.

## On Standards

We provide a friendly and peaceful workspace for new hackers and who wants to learn a better programming approach for his or her hacking. So we accept all kind of coding styles like BSD style, GNU style. Linux style or any other.

We are a free, open and collaborative community that respects users freedom and privacy.

## The C Programming Language and related fields in Computer area

C is a system programming language mainly. It's responsibility and working domain is BIOS, Bootloader, Kernel itself and the operating system utilities such as for a GNU and/or Linux system ls command.

So here is our list for Masscollabs Services and it's organizations :

* **Systems Programming**:
    * **Microsoft Windows Systems Programming**
    * **UNIX Systems Programming**: For Traditional UNIX approach, BSDs, GNU, Linux, and our Masscollabs approach to UNIX school.
    * **Assembly**: Where we dive into CPU and hardware knowledge.

And then we'll jump into userspace applications with C++ language for UNIX, Windows and for other like Haiku or our own experimental kernels or others'.
